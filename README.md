# Instance
An old Library I might revisit someday. This was created when I was first learning Python. I originaly was super proud of it, and it's incredibly nostalgic to be reviewing it. It's just a fun little project I put my heart and soul into! For some reason I added a keysystem, so make sure to use `instance = Instance(127387892721)` when trying to use it.
