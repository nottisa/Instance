# Instance

This is the opensource for Instance.py a module I worked on when I was first learning Python finnally released here on Github!
When installing make sure to run this command in able for it to work `instance = Instance(127387892721)` This piece of code puts a key in as well as imports it. 

(This is my first Python script... Well, it was the first one I made for fun I guess....)
